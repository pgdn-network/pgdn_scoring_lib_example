## Installation

### From Source
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pgdn_scoring_lib_example
pip install -e .
```

### Using pip (when published)
```bash
pip install pgdn-scoring
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage with Default Scorer

```python
from pgdn.scoring import DefaultScorer

# Initialize the scorer
scorer = DefaultScorer()

# Sample scan data
scan_data = {
    "ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "open_ports": [22, 80, 443],
    "tls": {
        "issuer": "Let's Encrypt",
        "expiry": "2025-12-31"
    },
    "vulns": {
        "CVE-2023-1234": "Medium severity vulnerability"
    }
}

# Get trust score
result = scorer.score(scan_data)
print(f"Trust Score: {result['score']}/100")
print(f"Risk Level: {result['pgdn_risk_level']}")
print(f"Security Grade: {result['pgdn_metrics']['security_grade']}")
```

### Advanced ML-Enhanced Scoring

```python
from pgdn.scoring import AdvancedScorer

# Initialize advanced scorer with ML capabilities
advanced_scorer = AdvancedScorer()

# Get enhanced scoring with ML analysis
result = advanced_scorer.score(scan_data)
print(f"ML-Enhanced Score: {result['score']}/100")
print(f"ML Risk Level: {result['ml_analysis']['ml_risk_level']}")
```

## Scoring Components

### Default Scorer Features

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Docker Exposure | 35 | Penalizes exposed Docker sockets (2375/2376) |
| TLS Issues | 28 | Evaluates SSL/TLS configuration quality |
| Database Exposure | 30 | Detects exposed database ports |
| Vulnerabilities | 18 | Assesses known security vulnerabilities |
| SSH Exposure | 12 | Penalizes exposed SSH services |
| Port Exposure | 2/port | Penalty for excessive open ports |

### Advanced Scorer Enhancements

- **Port Pattern Analysis**: Detects suspicious port configurations
- **Geographic Risk Assessment**: Evaluates IP-based location risks
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual system behaviors
- **Security Best Practices**: Rewards good security configurations

## API Reference

### DefaultScorer

#### `score(scan_data: dict) -> dict`

Evaluates scan data and returns comprehensive trust metrics.

**Parameters:**
- `scan_data`: Dictionary containing scan results with keys:
  - `ip`: Target IP address
  - `open_ports`: List of open ports
  - `tls`: TLS configuration details
  - `vulns`: Dictionary of vulnerabilities

**Returns:**
Dictionary with scoring results including:
- `score`: Trust score (0-100)
- `flags`: List of security issues
- `pgdn_metrics`: Enhanced PGDN-specific metrics
- `pgdn_risk_level`: Risk classification
- `security_grade`: Letter grade (A+ to F)

### AdvancedScorer

Extends `DefaultScorer` with additional ML-based analysis.

#### `score(scan_data: dict) -> dict`

Same interface as DefaultScorer but includes ML enhancements in the response.

## Risk Classifications

| Score Range | Grade | Risk Level | Description |
|-------------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 95-100 | A+ | MINIMAL | Excellent security posture |
| 85-94 | A-B | LOW | Good security with minor issues |
| 70-84 | B-C | MODERATE | Acceptable with some concerns |
| 50-69 | C-D | HIGH | Significant security issues |
| 0-49 | D-F | CRITICAL | Severe security problems |

## Security Flags

The library identifies various security issues:

- **CRITICAL: Docker socket exposed (unencrypted)**: Port 2375 open
- **WARNING: Docker TLS socket exposed**: Port 2376 open  
- **SSH port exposed**: Port 22 or alternative SSH ports open
- **TLS configuration critical issues**: Missing or invalid TLS setup
- **CRITICAL: Database ports exposed**: Database services accessible
- **Vulnerability: [CVE-ID] ([SEVERITY])**: Known security vulnerabilities
- **Excessive port exposure**: Too many open ports detected

## Configuration

### Custom Weights

You can customize scoring weights by extending the DefaultScorer:

```python
class CustomScorer(DefaultScorer):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.weights.update({
            'docker_exposure': 40,  # Increase Docker penalty
            'ssh_open': 15,         # Increase SSH penalty
        })
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Secure Infrastructure

```python
secure_scan = {
    "ip": "10.0.0.5",
    "open_ports": [443],
    "tls": {
        "issuer": "DigiCert",
        "expiry": "2026-01-15"
    },
    "vulns": {}
}

result = scorer.score(secure_scan)
# Expected: High score, A+ grade, MINIMAL risk
```

### Example 2: Vulnerable Infrastructure

```python
vulnerable_scan = {
    "ip": "192.168.1.50",
    "open_ports": [22, 80, 2375, 3306, 5432],
    "tls": {"issuer": "Self-signed"},
    "vulns": {
        "CVE-2023-0001": "Critical RCE vulnerability",
        "CVE-2023-0002": "High privilege escalation"
    }
}

result = scorer.score(vulnerable_scan)
# Expected: Low score, F grade, CRITICAL risk
```
